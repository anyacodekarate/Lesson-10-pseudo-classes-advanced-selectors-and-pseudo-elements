    <p>Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material (the fuel) in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat,
    light, and various reaction products. At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames
    are produced. The flame is the visible portion of the fire.</p>

    <p>a clear colourless tasteless odourless liquid that is essential for plant and animal life and constitutes, in impure
    form, rain, oceans, rivers, lakes, etc. It is a neutral substance, an effective solvent for many compounds, and is used
    as a standard for many physical properties.</p>

    <p>Air is important to us for many reasons. Of foremost importance to humans and animals is the fact that air carries the
    oxygen we need to live. Air also makes fire possible, which provides us with heat, light, and energy. Other uses of air
    make our lives easier or more pleasant.</p>

    <p>In short, soil is a mixture of minerals, dead and living organisms (organic materials), air, and water. These four
    ingredients react with one another in amazing ways, making soil one of our planet's most dynamic and important natural
    resources. Soil is used by people in numerous ways.</p>

    <p>Spirit is the courage and determination that helps people to survive in difficult times and to keep their way of life
    and their beliefs. She was a very brave girl and everyone who knew her admired her spirit. Spirit is the liveliness and
    energy that someone shows in what they do. They played with spirit.</p>
